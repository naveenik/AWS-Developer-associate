1. VPC flow logs
Its a feature that enables to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network instnaces in your VPC
Cloudtrail: It used to track the API call 
AWS Inspector:
Its an automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of application deployed on AWS

2. Alarm:
set the Evaluationn period and Datapoints to Alarm  --- Alarming for 3 points consecutively breached
high resolution metric alarm specify when you have 10 secounds or 30 secounds monitoring scenario
use Metric math in Cloudwatch to properly compute the  threshold - applicable for query multiple cloudwatch metrics or to create a new time series bases on selcted metrics

3. Environment variables for lambda functions: Enable you to dynamically pass settings to your function code and libraries without making changes to yourcode
stage variables : Its only available for API gateway and not in lambda
layer: A layer is ZIP archieve that contains libraries, custom runtime or other dependencies
Aliases: pointer to specific lambda function version 
by using aliases you can access the lambda function which the alias is to

4. Developer to trace the event source through lambda function
aws cloudwatch to automatically emit metrics and logs for all invocations and AWS X-RAY for tracing the application request detailly
AWS system maanger - used to view operational data for groups of resourcs such as RDS, EC2, S3 0 - wrong  answer
Amazon Inspector - security assessments that help for unintended  network accessibility of your Amazon EC2 instances and vulnerabilities of EC2.

5. DynamoDB table with DynamoDB streams Enabled, item is updated should send only copy of items to S3.
StreamViewType determines what informaion need for this table

OLD IMAGE - Sends only old data before modified - Correct answer
NEW IMAGE - Send only new data after modified - wrong answer
KEYS_ONLY - Key attributes are modified values stored - wrong answer
NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGE - Store both before and after modified

6. lambda function need to refactor to process the data within your VPC rather than initial outside GraphQL

Add a NAT gateway to your VPC and ensure associated security groups with lambda functions allows outbound connections
ENI it provides connect to others services in AWS within your private VPC  - wrong answer

7. developer need to ensure all changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored to another DynaomoDB in another region

DyanmoDB Accelatoe - To increase the performance of the DynamoDB table with response in microsecound for millions of requests - wring answer
DynamoDB point in time Recovery - It helps protect your DynamoDB tables from accidental write or delete operations - wring answer
DyanmoDB Stream - It captures the time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in any DynamoDB table for upto 24Hours can veiw before and after modify - correct answer

8. EC2 instance that need provision VPC, require acess to S3 bucket.

S3 is not part of your VPC, unlike EC2 Instance, EBS Volumes, ELBs and other services typically residence your nwetwork
so EC2 instance need to have access to the internet to access S3

VPC Endpoint to S3 will access - correct answer
Create IAM role and attach to instance - but no connectivitu between servies - wrong answer

9. lambda function has intermittent issue in processiong customer data, which environment variables used by AWS lambda
to facilate the communciation with  X-RAY

AWS X-Ray is an AWS services that allows you to detect, analyze and optimize performance issues with AWS lamnda functions
so AWS lambda uses environment variables to facilate the communication with X-Ray Daemon 

X_AMZN_TRACE_ID : contains tracing header, trace_id, and parent segment_id when lambda fucntion is invoked
AWS_XRAY_CONTEXT_MISSING : Its behavior function tries to record X-Ray data 
AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS: It expose the X-Ray daemon address in the following format IP_ADDRESS:PORT

X_AMZN_TRACE_ID and AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS are correct answer

10. lambda function which process notifications S3, 50 request per secound and each request take 100 secound to complete

Concurrent executions refers to number of executions of your function code, we can also estimate
concurrent executions = invocationn  per secound * average execution duration
by default AWS lambda limits total concurrent executions 1000 within a region
so expected concurrent increases the defaut, Request for AWS to increase the limit of your concurrent executions - correct answer

11. A task placement strategy is an algorithm for selecting instance for task placement or task termination
ECS has following task placement strategies

Binpack: place task based on least available amount of CPU or memmory 
Random: place task randomly
spread: place task based on the specified value, attribute key-value pairs, instance id or host
distinctInstance: Its not valid task placement strategy, but this is used as a constraint to place each task on a different container instance.

12. A client want to fetch latest data from API gateway, and invalidate the existing cache how to implement

have a client send request with  Cache-Control: max-age=0 header   --- correct answer
Allowing client to access end-point directly is incorrect because the purpose of placing API gateway in-front of your End-point is to not to expose
your endpoints to the public and risk-security  issues  --- wrong answer

13. Mission critical application need to monitor to provide immedite insight its sub-minute activity, need to collect logged users for every 10 secounds
Each metric in one of following:
Standard resolution - Data having 60 secounds granularity
High resolution - Dataa a granularity of 1 secound

Publish a high resolution custom metric to cloudwatch --- correct
Publish a custom metric to cloudwatch using PUTmetric ---storage-resolution set to default --- wrong because of default is 60 secounds

14. Client wants to retireve latest data from dynamoDB table, although caching is enabled we want specific client they want to retrive latest data
how to make the configuration ?

Tick the Require Authorization(not every client invalidate cache) in cache settings and the client must send a request contains cache-control max-arg=0 header   --- correct
 
15. Developer uses AWS SAM templates to deploy a serverless application, he need embed applicaiton to aws serverless Application repository

AWS::Serverless::Application    --- to define nested application into your serverless       --- correct
AWS::Serverless::LayerVersion   --- resource type layer for libraries or runtime function
AWS::Serverless::Api            --- resource type desceribe Api 
AWS::Serverless::Funtion        --- resource type describes creating lambda function

16: As DyanmoDB Table grows, how to improve the performance of Application with minimal cost

using Query operations and Reduce Page size --- correct
scan - it scans the entire table 
DyanmoDB Accelator - It will add cost by maintaing scalability and read performace
Increasing WCU - It will increase the cost

17. AWS codecommit repository to create and delete in order to maintain unique repository what are the least prevelages required?

CodeCommit: CreateRepository and CodeCommit: DeleteRepository    ---- correct
CodeCommit: CreateBranch and CodeCommit: DeleteBranch   ---- wrong because specific to only branch not the repository

18. lambda function event source mapping through API Gateway, 10 request and 50 secouns to complete
how to prevent the throttling?

Concurretn executions = invocations per secound * average execution duration
By default AWS lmanda limits is 1000 in which more requied requested through raising request for AWS to concurrent excutions
under this automatically lambd will scale the load

19. lambda function download the file 55MB from external repository, this cause function timeout intermittently
how to refrator to solve the issue

Store the file in the:  /tmp directory of the execution context and reuse it on succeding invocations

20. Developer wants a multihreaded event based key/values pairs that will cache the results

both redis and memcache have same features with some differen based on scenarios
simplest model and Multitreaded ---- Memcached     --- correct
single threaded server advanced data structure --- Redis
Amazon Cloudfront --- Content Delivery Network which delivers statis, dynamic and interactive content using global network of edge locations
IoT Greengas --- to enable connected devices to run AWS lambda functions to execute machine learning models keeping device sync on

21. Requirement to configure the application to retrieve data from database only in the event cache miss

lazy loading: Is a caching strategy loads data into the cache only when neccessary

22. online trading application requires database can scale globally, handle frequent schema changes 

DynamoDB : Ideal for flexible schemas like semi or unstructured data
RDS and Aurors: Ideal for rigid schema

23. A company need all database credentials to be encrypted and automatically rotated

AWS secrets manager it easier to manage secrets, passowrds and thrid-party API Keys and enabling automatic rotation --- correct
Systems Manager parameter - Doesn't rotate parameters 
createing IAM role and attaching - even though IAM role provide permission to access, it can't rotate the credentials

24. ECS cluster process large stream data and store result in DynamoDB, There is a urgent requirement to detect new entries in table 
and automatically trigger lambda function

Enable DynamoDB streams to detect new entries and automatically trigger the lambda function

25. Global secoundary Index and Local secoudary index concepts need to look
